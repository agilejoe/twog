h1. twog

h2. Install

sudo gem install twog

h2. OAuth

Please read "this":http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/2010/04/02/oauth.html if you want to know how to get your Twitter OAuth consumer key/secret and access token/secret.
One you have those, run the rake command:

bq. rake generate_config

and a hidden configuration file will be created in the your home folder (~/.twog.yaml).  Once there, please fill it out with the information necessary to use this tool.

h2. Bitly API

In order to use Bitly for URL shortening, you'll need to go to http://bit.ly and click the "Sign Up":http://bit.ly/account/register?rd=/ link on the top right and get an account.  Once you are logged-in you click the "Account":http://bit.ly/account link in the same top right area.  You will see your API Key in the middle of the page.

Put your bit.ly username and api key into the ~/.twog.yaml file to be used in the code.

h2. cron

The idea is to setup cron to run the bin/twog script.

"Crontab HowTo":http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html

For example, I run 'crontab -e' and this lets me edit my user's crontab file and I put the following:

bq. */15 * * * * jmeridth twog 

Will be wiring up the cronedit gem later

h2. TODO

Please check the TODO file for items that are to be done in the near future.
