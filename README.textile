h2. OAuth

Please read "this":http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/2010/04/02/oauth.html if you want to know how to get your Twitter OAuth consumer key/secret and access token/secret.
One you have those, run the command:

bq. twog --conf

and a hidden configuration file will be created in the your home folder (~/.twog/conf.yaml).  Once there, please fill it out with the information necessary to use this tool.

h2. Bitly API

In order to use Bitly for URL shortening, you'll need to go to http://bit.ly and click the "Sign Up":http://bit.ly/account/register?rd=/ link on the top right and get an account.  Once you are logged-in you click the "Account":http://bit.ly/account link in the same top right area.  You will see your API Key in the middle of the page.

Put your bit.ly username and api key into the ~/.twog/conf.yaml file to be used in the code.

bq. twog --cronadd N

where N is the number of minutes you want twog to fire off every time.

To remove twog as a crontab job, run the command:
